"The Doctor" is the alias assumed by a centuries-old alien who travels through space and time in his TARDIS, frequently with companions.
The doctor has a biological function allowing him to completely change his cellular structure and appearance so as to recover from a fatal injury.
Therefore, you cannot really get rid of The Doctor.
