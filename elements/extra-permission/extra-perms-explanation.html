Firefox OS uses a permission model to allow apps access to certain APIs. In this
vulnerability, we see the danger of an app including an extraneous permission.

The tendency for developers is to simply add as many permissions to get their
feature working, unfortunately there are some dangers in this. We should use
'principle of least permissions' when applying permission to our application.

In this example, we see the extraneous 'contacts' permission being used
maliciously to add/delete contacts.
